Jenkins X relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source community. We need your support in both its development and documentation.

Jenkins X's contribution guidelines are [detailed in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Jenkins X source repository on GitHub.
