Jenkins X can be installed on 1.8 or later of Kubernetes. The requirements are:

* RBAC is enabled
* insecure docker registries are enabled. This is so that pipelines can use a docker registry running inside the kubernetes cluster (which typically is not public so no https support). You can modify your pipelines to use other registries later.

### Enabling insecure registries on kops

Note that if you are on AWS you may want to use the [jx create aws](/getting-started/create-cluster/) command which automates all of this for you!

If you created the kubernetes cluster via [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) then you can do the following:

```
kops edit cluster 
```

Then make sure the YAML has this `docker` entry:

```yaml 
...
spec:
  docker:
    insecureRegistry: 100.64.0.0/10
``` 

That IP range, `100.64.0.0/10`, works on AWS but you may need to change it on other kubernetes clusters; it depends on the IP range of kubernetes services.
 
Then save the changes. You can verify your changes via:

```
kops get cluster -oyaml
```

and looking for the `insecureRegistry` section.

Now to make this change active on your cluster type:

```
kops update cluster --yes
kops rolling-update cluster --yes
```

You should now be good to go!

### Installing Jenkins X

To install Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster you can then use the [jx install](/commands/jx_install) command:

    jx install

If you know the provider you can specify that if you prefer on the command line. e.g.

    jx install --provider=aws
