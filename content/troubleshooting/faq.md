We have tried to collate common issues here with work arounds. If your issue isn't listed here please [let us know](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/new).
 
### Cannot create cluster minikube
If you are using a Mac then `hyperkit` is the best VM driver to use - but does require you to install a recent [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) first. Maybe try that then retry `jx create cluster minikube`?

If your minikube is failing to startup then you could try:
 
    minikube delete
    rm -rf ~/.minikube

If the `rm` fails you may need to do:

    sudo rm -rf ~/.minikube

Now try `jx create cluster minikube` again - did that help? Sometimes there are stale certs or files hanging around from old installations of minikube that can break things.

Sometimes a reboot can help in cases where virtualisation goes wrong ;)

Otherwise you could try follow the minikube instructions 

* [install minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation)
* [run minikube start](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#quickstart) 

### Minkube and hyperkit: Could not find an IP address

If you are using minikube on a mac with hyperkit and find minikube fails to start with a log like:

```
Temporary Error: Could not find an IP address for 46:0:41:86:41:6e
Temporary Error: Could not find an IP address for 46:0:41:86:41:6e
Temporary Error: Could not find an IP address for 46:0:41:86:41:6e
Temporary Error: Could not find an IP address for 46:0:41:86:41:6e
```

It could be you have hit [this issue in minikube and hyperkit](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1926#issuecomment-356378525).

The work around is to try the following:

```
rm ~/.minikube/machines/minikube/hyperkit.pid
``` 

Then try again. Hopefully this time it will work!

### Cannot access services on minikube

When running minikube locally `jx` defaults to using [nip.io](http://nip.io/) as a way of using nice-isn DNS names for services and working around the fact that most laptops can't do wildcard DNS. However sometimes [nip.io](http://nip.io/) has issues and does not work.

To avoid using [nip.io](http://nip.io/) you can do the following:

Edit the file `~/.jenkins-x/cloud-environments/env-minikube/myvalues.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
expose:
  Args:
    - --exposer
    - NodePort
    - --http
    - "true"
```

Then re-run `jx install` and this will switch the services to be exposed on `node ports` instead of using ingress and DNS.

So if you type:

```
jx open
```

You'll see all the URs of the form `http://$(minikube ip):somePortNumber` which then avoids going through [nip.io](http://nip.io/) - it just means the URLs are a little more cryptic using magic port numbers rather than simple host names.
